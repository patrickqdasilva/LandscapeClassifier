# Deep Learning Model for Classifying Landscape
###  Patrick Da Silva
* This notebook will walk through the steps from from image collection to deploying the model.
* The model is fed aerial images of rural and suburban landscapes.
* Given novel images, the model will be able to fit the photo into each class accordingly.
* I use an extensive amount of comments in this project to aid in my learning and to make sure I understand exactly what each step is doing.
* The image classification model pipeline was inspired by Nicholas Renotte
